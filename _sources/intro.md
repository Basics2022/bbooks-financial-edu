# Financial Education

This book is meant to collect some notes about financial instruments and methods for financial education, and mainly focused asset allocation.

This material is part of the [**basics-books project**](https://basics2022.github.io/bbooks). It is also available as a [.pdf document](_build/latex/book.pdf).

```{admonition} Main goal
:class: tip

The ultimate goal of this material is to develop an understanding of how to manage personal savings efficiently, in line with one's own reasonable objectives.

To achieve this, some intermediate goals include:
- gaining knowledge of the **macroeconomic environment**
- familiarizing with some of the most common **investment tools** (mainly bonds and stocks);
- getting used to some **common-sense** and **investing principles**: minimizing certain costs when conditions are equal, risk/reward, diversification, liquidity, and other constraints/inefficiencies
- learning **what not to do**
- and once the poor choices have been ruled out, evaluating the reasonable options for building and managing an investment portfolio, using mainly [**ETF**s](fin-edu:assets:etfs) as a natural choice of a (usually) liquid asset providing diversification at low cost, even for small capitals.
