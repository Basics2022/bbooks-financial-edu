## Risk

Risk measures uncertainty and its effects, combining probability of events and consequences of specific events. *All the assets have some systematic and some specific risks*
.
<!-- Some risks are systematic (like market crashes); others are specific (like a company going bankrupt).-->
Key measures (*should give info about magnitude, frequency/probability, and duration*) include:
- standard deviation or **volatility**: how much returns may deviate from their expected value),
- max loss (usually 100% can't be neglected for catastrophic although rare events), value at risk (VaR, max loss with a given probability), drawdown (maximum peak-to-trough loss)
- time-to-recover (time to recover drawdowns, in a temporal perspective)

Usually, risk metrics measure uncertainty, without discerning from positive and negative events: these metrics perceive a higher-than-expected return as a risk as well. Some metrics instead, see *Sortino ratio* in [risk-return](fin-edu:principles:rr) section, aims at quantifying only negative events as risk.

```{prf:example} Value at Risk

A 1-year 5% VaR of $1000\text{â‚¬}$ of an investment it means that there's 5% probability of losing at least $1000\text{â‚¬}$ in a year with that investment.

```
