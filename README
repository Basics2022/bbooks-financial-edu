# Financial Education

Some notes about financial education at https://basics2022.github.io/bbooks-financial-edu/intro.html.

**Disclaimer.** These notes are mainly for personal use, but you can feel free to use at your own risk.

These notes wants to be a clean and a basic quantitative approach to investing,
- preventing from over-thinking and over-talking about topics: content creators live with views and streams, but a video on YouTube or a podcast on Spotify could be not the best way for quite a systematic approach to the subject (time-consuming, no solid reference, no plots you can play with, no math at all and no details - and assumptions - about the results presented,...)
- providing that material for quite a systematic approach to investing, discussing quite in details some of its basic principles, first with toy-problems and then with real-world data. *inflation and need for some methods to save the value of the personal wealth*, *riks/return*, *diversification*, *effect of time (I): compounding*, *effect of volatility: volatility drag*, *portfolio construction: different approaches*, *effect of time (II): re-balancing*

**todo** *Write an introduction*

A bit of context is essential. It allows us to cut through the more eccentric theories circulating today, to recognize the risks hidden within certain “unorthodox” or “modern” interpretations, and to avoid wasting energy on ideas that distract rather than enlighten—energy that could instead be used to develop informed, constructive critiques of the system.

For this reason, the book begins with a clear overview of the modern economic framework. We will explore its key players and the instruments they use, tracing their evolution over time. This historical lens is not meant as an academic detour, but as a practical tool: understanding where these institutions and mechanisms come from helps us grasp why they exist, how they function, and what their limitations may be.
