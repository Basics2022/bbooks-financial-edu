    "Investing is a core part of personal financial management—it's how individuals navigate uncertainty to meet their financial goals under real-world constraints. The most basic objective is to preserve the real value of wealth, protecting it against [inflation](fin-edu:inflation); more ambitious goals include growing capital to fund retirement, education, or other life plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sound investing requires understanding [return](fin-edu:principles:return) and [risk](fin-edu:principles:risk) of available assets, and the fundamental [R/R trade off](fin-edu:principles:rr). It also demands attention to **constraints** such as *liquidity* needs, *time horizon*, *acceptable volatility*, and *risk tolerance*. One of the main principle is [diversification](fin-edu:principles:diversification) - which can reduce risk and, in some cases, enhance returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section introduces the core concepts needed to build a robust investment strategy: how [compound returns](fin-edu:principles:time:compunding) shape long-term growth, how [volatility drag](fin-edu:principles:time:volatility-drag) reduces expected performance, and how a clear, principle-based approaches - like [rebalancing](fin-edu:principles:rebalancing) - may improve performance under uncertainties.\n",

    "Given its set of constraints, an informed and intelligent agent, see [Portfolio construction](fin-edu:principles:asset-allocation) would take actions that try to maximise return for a given accepted risk, or minimize risk for a given desired return: this behavior can be summarized in choosing actions on a *Pareto front*, i.e. within the set of all Pareto efficient solutions.\n",
