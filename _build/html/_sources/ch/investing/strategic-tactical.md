# Strategic and Tactical Asset Allocation

**Strategic Asset Allocation, (SAA)**. SAA is a long-term protfolio strategy, choosing asset class allocation following investor goals and constraints[^ips]. SAA involves [**rebalancing**](), to keep deviation from the desired asset allocation and volatility of the protfolio within a desired range.

<!--
[^ips]: Between investor and a investment managare, an IPS (Investment Policy Statement) collects the agreements between the parties on the managament of the investor money.
-->

**Tactical Asset Allocation, (TAA).** A TAA strategy uses a discretionary or quantitative investment model to take advantage of **inefficiencies or temporary imbalances** among different asset classes. <!--These shifts use a basis of known financial market anomalies, or inefficiencies, backed by academic and practitioner research.-->
